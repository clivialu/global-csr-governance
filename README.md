## In plain language

This research looks at how differences in national governance, legal systems, and cultural environments affect firms’ environmental and CSR behaviors worldwide.  
We find that countries with stronger corporate governance institutions and better legal protections tend to have companies that disclose more CSR information and perform better environmentally.  
Cultural dimensions — such as collectivism and power distance — influence how these governance factors translate into sustainability outcomes, suggesting that both institutional and cultural contexts matter for responsible business practices globally.
